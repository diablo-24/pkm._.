can truecaller read my gmail contacts or can they only read phone contacts

Short answer: **Truecaller can read your phone contacts, and it can read your Google (Gmail) contacts *only if you explicitly allow it*.**

Here’s the breakdown 👇

### 📱 Phone contacts

* **Yes, by default**, Truecaller requests permission to access your **device’s contacts**.
* If you grant this, it can read and upload the contacts stored on your phone (used for caller ID and spam detection).

### 📧 Gmail / Google contacts

* **Not automatically.**
* Truecaller **cannot read your Gmail contacts unless**:

  * You sign in using your **Google account**, **and**
  * You explicitly grant permission to access Google Contacts.
* If you deny that permission, Truecaller cannot see your Gmail contacts.

### 🔐 Important to know

* If your Gmail contacts are **synced to your phone**, then Truecaller can still see them indirectly **because they appear as phone contacts**.
* To fully prevent this, you’d need to:

  * Turn off Google Contacts sync on your phone, **or**
  * Deny contact access to Truecaller altogether.

### ✅ How to check / control this

* **Android**:
  Settings → Apps → Truecaller → Permissions → Contacts
* **Google account**:
  Google Account → Security → Third-party access → Remove Truecaller if listed

If you want, tell me:

* Android or iPhone?
* Whether you’re trying to **limit data sharing** or **delete already uploaded contacts**

I can give you precise step-by-step instructions for your case.
