## To-do's:
- [ ] figure out how to make daily notes next,prev navigation possible with weekday(i.e ddd) and if not possible remove it
- [ ] additionaly, maybe we can invest some time on calendar plugin to find out day of week, if and when needed, instead of hardcoding it on the file name.
- [ ] learn quick switcher
- [ ] note composer
- [ ] canvas
- [ ] bases
- [ ] file recovery
- [ ] command palette
