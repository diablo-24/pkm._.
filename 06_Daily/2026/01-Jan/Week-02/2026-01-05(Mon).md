## To-do's:
- [ ] figure out how to make daily notes next,prev navigation possible with weekday(i.e ddd) and if not possible remove it
- [ ] additionaly, maybe we can invest some time on calendar plugin to find out day of week, if and when needed, instead of hardcoding it on the file name.
- [ ] learn quick switcher
- [ ] note composer
- [ ] canvas
- [ ] bases
- [ ] file recovery
- [ ] command palette

## Ships log
1. {13:41} TIL: i could apply code formatter backticks (three-backticks pair) to an existing text by selecting it and pressing backtick key thrice
2. {18:03} this line is a test to see if sync is smooth across mobile  and desktop
3. {18:54} i read that if some file was added(tracked) to git, then it is tough to add it to list of ignored files(i.e., to .gitignore). so always add such filenames to .gitignore at the dawn of repo itself
4. {19:30} tried deleting wrkspce-mob.json and then adding filename to gitsync's gitignore; and commited said gitignore and pushed
5. even commited wrk-mob.json actual file deletion and pushed, later gitignore didn't seem to ignore wrkspce-mob.json
