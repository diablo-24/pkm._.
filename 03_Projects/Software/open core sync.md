how to make my obsidian open on a particular note irrespective

To set up Obsidian so that it always opens on a specific note, you need to ==use the "Open core sync" setting in the application's preferences==. 

Here is how to configure it:

1. **Open Settings**: Launch Obsidian and go to **Settings** (usually a gear icon in the bottom-left corner).
2. **Navigate to Core Sync**: In the Settings sidebar, look for and click on **Core Sync**.
3. **Enable "Open core sync"**: In the "Core Sync" settings, there should be an option like "Open core sync". Toggle this setting to **On**.
4. **Select a note**: After enabling the setting, a new option should appear allowing you to select which specific note you want to open every time the app starts. Use the provided interface to browse and select the desired note from your vault. 

Once configured, the specified note will automatically be the first thing you see when you open Obsidian, regardless of the note you were viewing when you last closed the application.
